# Ant-Mahjongg v1.2

## Overview

The Ant-Mahjongg v1.2 is a classic solitaire-style game that I developed between 2004 and 2005 using the Swing Framework. The application was published in 2005 on the Origo Szoftverb√°zis website.

## Requirements
Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 1.8

Note: The program is optimized for JRE 1.8 and may not run correctly on newer versions.

## Source code

The application was originally developed using JDK 1.5. However, I made several modifications to ensure compatibility with JDK 1.8, which allows the program to run on more widely supported Java environments. The project has also been restructured as a Maven project, preparing it for potential future development.

Additionally, all images and HTML files used by the program have been moved to the resources folder as part of this update.

## Home page

The game application also had a website, and its static version can be accessed at the following link:

## Additional Information

The application is designed for an 800x600 resolution, so the details may not display optimally on today's high-resolution monitors.
